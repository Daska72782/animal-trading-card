			<p>Lion's are highly social cats that live in prides of 30-40 members. The african lion is a member of the genus panthera and also joining tigers, jaguars and leopard family. A lion's roar can be heard from 5 miles away. The average weight of a male lion is 570 lbs. Male lions stay in their birth pride for 2 years then are kicked out. A lion's success rate of hunt is less than 30%, so that means that the female usually does the hunting. Their average lifespan is typically about 10-15 years on an average. </p>
